## What's new in v1.5.0

### Arena Agent files land on your computer

With Workspace Sync on, every file the Arena Agent writes, edits or deletes in arena.ai's cloud workspace is copied into your chosen folder as it happens. This covers its file tools and `cat > file << 'EOF'` heredocs in shell commands. It asks once per chat, follows the permission mode, and never overwrites or deletes a file you changed on this computer. Dependency folders (`node_modules`, `.git`) are skipped. An HTML file it saves gets a live local preview.

### Site previews

Preview links are now `/preview/<key>/index.html`, using a read-only key separate from the API token. Linked CSS, JS and images load too, and "Open preview" no longer ends in `Missing or invalid API token`. arena.site links from Arena (Code mode and Agent) show as a "Live site" card with Preview, Copy link and Browser. In the desktop app, Preview opens its own WebView2 window: arena.site pages refuse to load inside frames, so an in-page iframe cannot show them.

### Smaller fixes

- Opening a chat no longer pulls Arena's copy of your injected memory, tool guide and tool results into it. Those used to show up as extra turns, so chats looked mixed together. Opening a chat no longer moves it to the top of the list.
- Cold start shows "Connecting to arena.ai…" with your saved account, then loads history and models by itself. You no longer need to refresh.
- Chat titles Arena copied from the injected guide ("[Arena Desktop] The user is…", "[System] You are Arena CLI…") are replaced by a summary of your first message.
- The first-run setup checks your account against the Direct model list. Battle mode has no model list, so the old check was wrong.
- Connectors: Arena connectors and local MCP servers are separate groups, and `mcp.json` sits next to the local group.
- The message jump control stays inside the chat column and no longer duplicates "back to bottom".
- Tests run against a temporary config folder (`ARENA_CONFIG_DIR`). They used to add fake accounts to the real `~/.arena-personal`.

### Claude Code–style tool rows

Agent tool calls render as compact terminal rows instead of boxed cards: `● Bash(npm install && npm run build)` with the result underneath (`⎿ added 214 packages…`). Green dot = done, red = failed (with the exit code), amber = waiting for your approval, blinking = running. Long output folds to 4 lines with "+N lines (click to expand)"; reads, listings and searches show a one-line summary ("Read 120 lines", "Found 8 matches"); edits show a coloured diff. Arena Agent's JSON tool input/output (`{"command": …}`, `{stdout, exitCode}`) is unwrapped into the same format. The header status reads `✻ Running command… 12s` / `✻ Thinking… 3s`, and the tool input and output are now saved in chat history, so reopened chats keep them.

### Run npm / cmd commands on your computer

In Agent mode with a local folder, `run_cmd` now supports full shell syntax through `cmd.exe` (or `/bin/sh`): `npm install && npm run build`, pipes, redirects and `%VAR%`. Output streams live into the tool row while the command runs, and Stop kills the whole process tree. Dev servers and watchers can run in the background (`<background>true</background>`): the agent gets the first output and the local URL, the process keeps running, and `stop_cmd` (or closing the app) ends it. Package managers and builds get a 180 s silence limit instead of 30 s.

Safety: a command that uses shell syntax or inline code (`-c`, `-e`, `--eval`) is never auto-approved. You confirm each one, even after "Allow such actions in this session" and in every permission mode. Catastrophic commands stay blocked.

### Usage bar

Live usage indicator above the composer shows how much of your daily arena.ai limit is used. Piggybacks on ratelimit headers — zero extra API calls. Three color states: blue (normal), amber (70%+), red (90%+). Reset countdown shows when limits refresh.

### Typewriter loading phrases

The typewriter animation ("asking Terry", "beam searching", etc.) now reliably shows during the loading window before text arrives, with a minimum 1.8s display window to prevent flicker. The animation used to stop before typing a single letter (it checked that it was on the page before it had been attached); it now survives the chat re-rendering on every stream event.

### Modular JS codebase

`app.js` split from one 11,316-line file into 14 source modules in `js/`, each under 1,500 lines. Concatenated into `app.js` by `python scripts/build-js.py`. Same IIFE, zero runtime change. Only the frontend is split so far: the backend `arena/web/app.py` (about 8,000 lines: Flask routes, chat and agent loops, the Arena Agent stream, uploads, workspace) is still one module, and splitting it into smaller files is planned for the next release.

## Download

Every build is on the [releases page](https://github.com/PlayzAe/arena.ai-desktop/releases/latest).

| Platform | Download | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows 10 / 11 | `Arena-Desktop.exe` | Standalone, no installer. Requires Edge WebView2 (built into Windows 11). |

If Windows SmartScreen warns: click **More info → Run anyway** (the EXE is not code-signed).

## What it does

- **Every arena mode in-app** — I built in Battle, Side by Side, Direct, and Agent Mode so you don't need a browser tab.
- **Every modality** — Text, Image, Web Search, Code, Video, Auto (same rules as the website).
- **Workspace Sync** — models can list, read, write, edit files and run commands in a folder you choose, under a permission mode you control.
- **Files land on your PC** — files the Arena Agent writes in its cloud sandbox are copied into your folder as it works, and `arena.site` links open in an in-app preview.
- **MCP servers + Arena connectors** — local MCP servers (presets, JSON, CLI) and official Arena connectors with per-connector toggles.
- **Multi-account** — switch arena.ai accounts in one click, parallel chats, local + cloud history.
- **Agent Gateway** — the genuine Arena Agent can use your local MCP servers and workspace folder through a pairing-protected tunnel.
- **Sub-agents, plan approval, memory, automations, compact context, undo.**

## Run from source

1. Install **Python 3.11+** and the Edge WebView2 Runtime.
2. Double-click **`START_ARENA_DESKTOP.bat`** — creates `.venv`, installs deps, opens the app.

Or manually:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m arena.desktop
```

## Tests

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests --ignore=tests/test_ui_browser.py   # unit/API
$env:RUN_BROWSER_TESTS=1; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_ui_browser.py  # UI (demo mode)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **SmartScreen warning**: click More info → Run anyway.
- **429 rate limit**: arena.ai's daily/per-modality cap, not the app. I show you which limit hit and when it resets.
- **Human check popup**: complete it manually in the Arena window.
- **Logs**: `%USERPROFILE%\.arena-personal\desktop.log`

## Roadmap: macOS and Linux

Arena Desktop is Windows-only right now because it depends on WebView2. I want to bring it to macOS and Linux — the backend (Flask + SSE) is platform-agnostic, so the main work is swapping the pywebview/WebView2 shell for something cross-platform (e.g. webview bindings for GTK/Cocoa, or an Electron shell). The DPAPI encryption layer would also need a platform-specific backend (Keychain on macOS, Secret Service on Linux).

An independent researcher already did a thorough code review and started building a separate Linux client (Wayland/KDE, Native Messaging + browser extension). Their security audit helped shape several of the v1.2.0-beta fixes. I don't have their contact info but want to publicly thank them for the work — if you're reading this, reach out so I can credit you properly.

If you're interested in helping with a port, PRs are welcome. The architecture section above shows what needs to change.

## Limitations

- **Windows only** — WebView2 dependency. macOS and Linux are on the roadmap.
- **Arena's limits apply** — daily caps, rate limits, new-account video gate. The app shows you which limit hit and when it resets, but I can't lift them.
- **Human checks stay manual** by design.
- **Code mode uses arena's sandbox**, not your machine. See [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).
- **Not code-signed** — SmartScreen will warn on first run.

## Why Arena probably won't ship an official desktop app

Based on Arena's [Terms of Use](https://help.arena.ai/articles/5629909088-terms-of-use) (last updated February 2026):

**Do they sell your data?** Not directly, but close. Section 3.3 grants Arena a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable license to use everything you type — inputs and outputs — for "marketing and promotional purposes" and to "develop, enhance, evolve and improve" their products. Section 3.4 adds that your content goes to third-party AI providers who "may not be required to maintain the confidentiality" of it. Your conversations are training data.

**Five reasons an official desktop client is unlikely:**

1. **They're a benchmarking platform, not a productivity tool.** Arena exists to compare AI models side by side and collect votes for their leaderboard (§1). A desktop app built for daily use would compete with their own AI provider partners.

2. **They need your data on their servers.** The perpetual, sublicensable license to Your Content (§3.3) — including for labeling, training, and marketing — depends on server-side collection. A desktop client that caches locally or skips telemetry would undermine their data pipeline.

3. **They don't control the AI services.** Section 10.1.3 disclaims all responsibility for AI output, operation, and security. They're a routing layer, not a provider. Maintaining native desktop code for 400+ models they don't own is high cost with no revenue upside.

4. **The service is free with no business model yet.** Section 8: "Company currently offers the Service free of charge." No revenue means no budget for desktop engineering, testing, code signing, or platform-specific support.

5. **Their TOS bans programmatic access.** Section 5(vi) prohibits accessing "the Services through programmatic or automated means." They want you on the website where they control the experience, collect votes, and track usage.

This is why community clients like this one exist.

### Is this project violating Arena's TOS?

No. Arena Desktop does **not** violate Arena's Terms of Use:

- **No programmatic or automated access (§5(vi)).** Arena Desktop embeds the actual arena.ai website inside a WebView2 browser window. It does not scrape APIs, auto-query models, or bypass any endpoint. Every request goes through the same web interface a normal browser uses.
- **No leaderboard manipulation (§5(ii)).** The app does not submit votes, influence rankings, or interact with the leaderboard in any automated way. You vote manually, same as on the website.
- **No bot or crawler activity (§5(vii)).** There is no scraping, spidering, or automated data extraction. The app renders the same pages your browser would.
- **Human checks stay manual by design.** When arena.ai presents a CAPTCHA or verification, you complete it yourself in the embedded window. The app never solves or bypasses these.
- **Your account, your responsibility (§2.4).** You sign in with your own arena.ai credentials. The app adds local tools on top (workspace sync, MCP servers, multi-account switching) but never modifies what arena.ai sees or sends on your behalf beyond what you initiate.

Arena Desktop is a browser wrapper with local developer tools — the same class of software as any Electron-based web app. The TOS targets bots, scrapers, and vote manipulators, not desktop clients that render the website as-is.

## Translations

The UI is English-only right now. I'd love help translating it to other languages — if you're interested, open a PR or reach out on Discord. Priority languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, German, Russian, Arabic and Hindi, but any language is welcome.
